# canopen

canopen lets you send and received data in a [CANopen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANopen) network.

The library contains basic functionality and doesn't aim to be a complete implementation of the CANopen protocol. You can find a complete CANopen implementation in the [CANopenNode](https://github.com/CANopenNode) project.

## CANopen

CANopen is a protocol to communicate on a CAN bus. Data is exchanged between nodes using CANopen frames, which uses a subset of the bytes in a CAN frames. This project extends the [can](https://github.com/brutella/can) library to interact with a CANopen nodes. Setup your hard- and software as described there.

You can find a very good documentation about CANopen [here](http://www.a-m-c.com/download/sw/dw300_3-0-3/CAN_Manual300_3-0-3.pdf).
