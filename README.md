# canopen

canopen lets you send and received [CANopen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANopen) data on CAN bus. The library contains basic building blocks and doesn't aim to be a complete implemenation of CANopen. You can find a complete CANopen implemenation in the [CANopenNode](https://github.com/CANopenNode) project.

## CANopen

CANopen is a protocol to communicate on a CAN bus. Data is exchanged between nodes using CANopen frames, which uses a subset of the bytes in a CAN frames. You can find a very good documentation about CANopen [here](http://www.a-m-c.com/download/sw/dw300_3-0-3/CAN_Manual300_3-0-3.pdf).
